# iuse-ium1

I created an Ultimaker Cura 4.7.0 Printer Profile for the 3d Printer IUSE IUM1 for myself and decided to share this to others.

Download URL for Ultimaker Cura 4.7 which is currently a free software. https://ultimaker.com/software/ultimaker-cura

There are 3 files:
  - A CAD STL file to show the printer name on the build plate.
  - A Definition file
  - A Extruder file
  
Place the CAD STL file into the Utimaker Cura 4.7.0 directory folder: C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 4.7\resources\meshes
Place the Definition file into the Ultimaker Cura 4.7.0 directory folder: C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 4.7\resources\definitions
Place the Extruder file into the Ultimaker Cura 4.7.0 directory folder: C:\Program Files\Ultimaker Cura 4.7\resources\extruders

Restart Utimaker Cura 4.7.0, add printer and look for and expand IUSE and select IUM-1 and follow the prompts.

Feel free to update the files as you see fit.

Happy 3D Printing

I will not have the time to provide guidance on what I have provided so hopefully this all works for you.

NOTE: If you get an error after adding the files, just delete the files and restart Cura and you'll be all good again.
